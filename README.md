# Dotfiles

Repository to setup a new machine, improving the bash experience and configurating the usual softwares used by me.

## Installation

Run the `./install` command to install the basic softwares to configurate, including `git`, `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh`, `asdf`, `vscode` and others.

- This script will configurate git ssh key on the first time. You may update to other ssh-key later, if you want too.
